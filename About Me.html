                        I am an outgoing
                        person, dedicated, and open-minded. I finished my matric at the year 2020 and I was able to score bachelors degree. I get across to people and be able to adjust to changes with
                        ease. I was once a participant in Innovation Hub school program back at 2018 while participating with other schools. I couldn't get my website creation certificate because I couldn't attend, I was ill at that time and I felt bad about it. I managed to get a participant certificate which I appreciated a lot and I enjoyed being a participant. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skils and learning
                        new things all the time. I have a friendly personality and enjoy interacting with others. I am
                        genuine, and other people can see tha I am authentic and honest. I am a hard worker and am
                        always putting in the extra effort to achieve my goals. I am at times innovative and always
                        looking for new ways to improve current systems and processes. I am a highly organised person. I
                        like to keep a clean workspace and always work with a positive mindset.I am results oriented,
                        constantly checking in with the goal to determine how
                        close or how far we are and what it will take to make it happen. I like to explore as many things as I can as long as I am interested in them, and I enjoy being behind the computer screen and working on something or researching about something.</h5>
